          A rose so blooms, your beauty takes my eye.
Your heart, a petal soft, unfolds with grace,
More fair than dawn, with love upon her face. <br />
<br />
Your laughter rings, a melody so sweet,
Like birdsong in the spring, a gentle treat.
Those eyes, twin pools where starlight softly gleams,
Reflecting kindness in their loving beams. <br />
<br />
Your touch, a whisper on the summer breeze,
Warmth that melts away all doubt and unease.
The warming  Smile, the sun that chases clouds away,
And fills my world with light, come what may.
